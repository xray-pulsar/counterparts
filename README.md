# X-ray counterparts of Rotation Powered Pulsars

The dataset represents the largest sample of X-ray counterparts of rotation powered pulsars (RPPs) ever compiled, including 98 normal pulsars (NPs) and 134 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). This catalogue is constructed by correlating ATNF pulsar catalogue v2.3.0, the Third Fermi/LAT Catalog of Gamma-ray Pulsars Catalog (3PC) with XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (4XMM-DR13 Version) and Chandra Source Catalog Release 2.0 (CSC 2.0).
The catalogue is free to use, and we ask that you please cite the published paper Xu et al. (2025). To report additions, corrections, or omissions, please email to wengss@njnu.edu.cn or xuuyj@stu.xmu.edu.cn.
